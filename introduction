# What is OpenEyes?
OpenEyes is a new specialist ophthalmic Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system:
* to automate and simplify the way Ophthalmologists capture ophthalmic medical records. However, paper-based practices still need to be done while additional functionality is completed in OpenEyes. 
* to comply with national cataract audit requirements set by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. Ophthalmologists will be contributing to the cataract audit from the first patient recorded on OpenEyes. There is a target of at least 100 operations recorded per cataract surgeon within OpenEyes so it is crucial that the system be used as soon as possible. 

# What Will Change?
OpenEyes will replace the following, initially for cataract surgery and soon for other ophthalmic subspecialties:
* details of the patient's medical, family and social history will now be captured in OpenEyes rather than on paper 
* details of the ophthalmic eye exam will be captured in OpenEyes rather than on paper 
* patient consent will be recorded in OpenEyes, with consent forms being printed from OpenEyes for the patient to sign 
* cataract surgery patients will be listed in OpenEyes rather than on paper. The Bookings Team will have instant access to the relevant parts of the patient's medical record to assist with scheduling. 
* biometry details and lens choice will be recorded on OpenEyes - at the moment, the initial biometry measurements and lens choice need to be made on paper as we cannot interface the existing IOL Master devices with the network 
* prescriptions following cataract surgery will be made on OpenEyes - these will need to be printed out but mean the prescription details are recorded electronically 
* all clinic and post-surgery correspondence will be produced in OpenEyes rather than by dictation. We have developed a set of templates specifically for East Kent and, once the letters have been approved within OpenEyes, they can be sent directly to GPs. 
* all optometrist follow-up appointment details will be recorded online and sent immediately to OpenEyes rather than needing to wait for paper forms to be sent be mail, fax, etc. 

# What OpenEyes Cannot Yet Do
Currently, there are some areas that OpenEyes will not be able to handle electronically. The following need to stay on paper: 
* general observations (blood pressure, pulse, temperature and similar) 
* Aside from INR, blood tests cannot be recorded in OpenEyes. The system allows you to add specific risks (e.g. vCJD, MRSA, cannot lie flat) 
* full pre-assessment, pre-surgery checks and some other aspects because OpenEyes does not have a "checklist" function. 

# Which Patients Will Go Onto OpenEyes?
All new patients to the Cataract service will be recorded on OpenEyes and the full electronic record will be available by the patient's day of surgery. However, some patients will already have been through pre-assessment and will not have an existing record on OpenEyes when the come in for surgery. Ophthalmologists still need to capture details of these patients to meet the 100 operations target. This is so the surgeon can record a cut-down version of the patient's history in theatre when they are recording details of the operation itself.

# How Are Patients Added to OpenEyes?
OpenEyes and PAS have been configured so that all patients being booked into ANY ophthalmic clinic are added to OpenEyes. This will ensure that even patients who are listed for cataract surgery from a non-cataract clinic are available in OpenEyes.

# How Are Patient Details Maintained in OpenEyes?
Some patient details, for instance, their name, age, address, GP and similar, can be maintained in PAS so that the core hospital systems are always correct. These details cannot be edited in OpenEyes and MUST be edited in PAS; the OpenEyes - PAS link will ensure that all changes made to these details in PAS are copied to OpenEyes within a few minutes.
